## Walking Isochrone Generation Tool 🗺️

### Features
This is a super useful tool that helps you easily generate walking isochrone maps! No need to worry about complex calculations; just provide the starting point coordinates, and it can:

🏃‍♀️ Calculate a 1000-meter walking isochrone based on the given starting point.
🧭 Intelligently consider geographical obstacles and actual walking paths.
🖼️ Output high-quality PNG format maps.

### Preparations
#### Required Libraries
Ensure these Python libraries are installed (you can install them with pip):

```sh
pip install osmnx networkx matplotlib shapely geopandas contextily numpy tqdm pandas pypinyin matplotlib-scalebar
```

#### Input Data Format
Prepare a file named `metrostation.CSV` with each line in the following format:

```
Station Name (Longitude, Latitude)
```

For example:

```
Tuan Dao (120.2945709, 36.057163)
```

### Usage
1. Place your `metrostation.CSV` file in the same directory as the program.
2. Run the program:

```sh
python main.py
```

Then sit back and wait for the results! The program will display the processing progress and detailed information.

### How It Works
This tool performs its magic as follows:

📥 **Data Preparation**: Fetch road network data within a 4km radius of the starting point.
🌐 **Network Analysis**: Project coordinates and build a network model.
⏱️ **Isochrone Calculation**: Generate a 1000-meter walking reachable area.
🎨 **Visualization Output**: Generate a beautiful map and save it as a PNG.

### Output
All generated maps will be saved in the `Isochrone Results` folder, with filenames formatted as:

```
StationNamePinyin_1000m_Walking_Isochrone.png
```

### Special Features
🔄 Batch processing of multiple starting points.
🧩 Automatically handles and simplifies isochrone contours.
🗺️ Integrates OpenStreetMap base maps.
📏 Automatically adds a scale bar and legend.
🌈 Beautiful visualization effects.

### Tips
- If you encounter errors reading the coordinate file, check if the file format is correct.
- The program will automatically convert Chinese station names to Pinyin for file naming.
- The default isochrones are blue lines, with the starting point marked by a red star.

Give it a try! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to provide feedback~ 😊
